"I am a software engineer fresh out of college and have been working in a software company for the past  6months- specifically system software-core. I am a computer science engineer from a reputed Indian engineering college.

I am planning to do an MBA within the next couple of years or so. I have a few assumptions for which I need validation- I am of the opinion that the work experience I'm gaining will not be of much value for admission into an MBA college as well as after the course. So I'm thinking of shifting to a business intelligence company. I think this would be apt for me before an MBA since this would not only harness my technical skills but also expose me to the business aspects, which is so not the case in my current job. 

So I wanted to know if my assumptions are correct. Also, which type of company should I join-something like JP Morgan which has major BI teams already or some start up, tons of which are coming up. 
And, what is the knowledge I am expected to have in case I go for an interview in one of these companies?
Lastly, should I also keep my college achievements in my resume, since there are hardly any achievements in my professional life till now.
