"I think the best way for a woman to avoid rape in this sex starved country is to be armed.. And I mean armed by anything -  a gun, knife, pepper spray..  You cannot expect a labour from Bihar or UP  who has come to Delhi to understand that a girl's short dress is not an invitation to rape and he should keep his dick in control.. I read a news item today where a Delhi girl was kidnapped and her body was found in Punjab!! As I know someone in that girl's family I know that the cook of the PG she was staying in is missing since the same day, of course the police is not registering a case to rest their lazy asses..
Will doing more of the protest marches save someone from getting raped?? This guy probably doesn't even read papers or watch news channels.. He saw a girl and as she was alone he decided to rape her!

This class of our society does not give a fuck about law and order and is least affected by what is going on in the world.. All they care about is satisfying their own sexual needs and then go to another Indian state to get a job and do the same

It's time that we make self defense classes mandatory for women in offices, schools even residential complexes.. And give the women the technology to call for help if required. Smart phones have such applications.. educate women, even the school girls about them.. they also have a phone nowadays.. Even a Pepper spray can be a good weapon agaonst these dicka.. Fail to understand why every girl doesn't carry one in her big bag which can carry 100 things at a time..!!??

"Objective vs subjective?
Can someome explain to me objective vs subjective in linguistics, and more over computational linguistics.
Now I know some people seem to take the post modernist view, but if you take that view everything is subjective.
The view I take is more or less in the 'mind' in a literal sense, I quoted 'mind' because I don't think the fact that it's a mind matters anything that could communicate on any kind of level would count.
So if someone said they where angry I wouldn't necessisarly see that as subjective, I may for instance say I can see you are angry. If someone said they felt bad I would see that as subjective because the meaning of bad is held in the mind.
There are also levels of subjectivity and objectivity, especially when context is taken into account.

So,
What's wrong with tap water, wrong is subjective in this sense and ambitious.
You got that math question wrong, isn't subjective, but may have some associated emotive elements.

I'd say tap water is more objective and less subjective than just water, since water holds more in the mind as to what kind of water than tap water does.

This partly relates to the countability and type of things, so the easiyness of comparing sets for instance. So the set of fruit, the set of exercise, the set of bottles, the set of objects, the set of an orange, the set of oranges.

One measure of objectivity is testabality, so obviouslly the size and type of the set relates to how easilty testable something is.


The kind of language features in conversation I'm trying to pick up are.


Someone wants to talk about cars
The other person talks about my car this my car that
The first person says , I wanted to talk about cars but all he talked about was himself
The first person doesn't say that if the second person says I saw a car.....

In that case the person is ignoring the objetive of the second speaker and only picking up on the subjective.

A better example would be
Tell me about you car....
My car this my car that
I asked him to tell me about his car but all he talked about was himself.

So that's one set.

The other set is people changing the subject and the object in the conversation. So on one level being very objective about something, but in context being very subjective because the different between the set of things the person original was talking about and when the person has changed it two is very great. Subjectivity only really being able to be determined in context where as the sentence etc... May be extreamly objective in itself.

I'm not interested really in morallity or that kind of 'subjectivity' that comes from post modernism, since that in itself is very subjective. A Dr telling me I could only have one pint of beer a week seems harsh, unless I'm in a muslim country for instance. But one pint of beer a week is very objective, easily testable, in itself?


Actually I kind of asked two things but didn't separate them.
Yes I'm interested in 'personal'/emotive but not necessisarly emotional language as one aspect of subjectity. But I want to know two things really.
What seperates  subjective vs objective, ignoring emotive content just looking at if the content is held in the mind vs testable. So for instance bad as opposed to sad where bad could mean sad but it could also mean in pain or anxious etc..... That bit is held in the mind.
What identifies language as being 'personal' so emotive vs non personal. So for instance omnipotent vs the number 3
So two dimentions of subjectivity and one of objectivity



If I give another opposing example, what is called taking things litrally.
I said and then one day I though to my self fuck-em all
The other person said
What you raped them

Taking the objective, literal, view of fuck-em all not the subjective ambigious view

I can probably think of some non emotive examples but I remember the emotive ones more clearly and there is usually an emotive element, but that's on a multi dimentional axis.



Another example of different language use would be objectifying something that's subjective, but not commonly emotional. That is objectifying but in a personal way.

So for instance, yes I know this could be emotive to 'SOME',
Gay people like kylie manogue
The other person says you can't generalize

Which isn't true, I could say smoking causes cancer or men are taller than women
It's a bit like the IQ test gay people like kylie manogue, but not all gay people like kylie manogue and not all people who like kylie manogue are gay, but yes gay people do like her, for one and for two SHE'S A GAY ICON, so one would assume that a greater percentage of gay people like her than strait people so it's a gay trait.",1428,Computational Linguistics,AAEAAJWf3O2w8BvUigr7ucJtMUlG/iyeJTQiq07qv6zVzXvZ,False,31.0
